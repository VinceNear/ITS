# Starting a new project.


Hello all and thank you for taking the time to visit this site.

I have been looking to start a nice new project over the past few months while in qaurintune and thought that a file host would be a nice project to start and build upon. You can find my site
at the following page at the top labeled "papaya.moe" It was an old domain that I had that was just sitting around and I wante to make use of it and I am hoping that I can start hosting files with a limit of 100mb

I may up this in the future but as I add more feaures to this project I hope you will use it.

Thanks for being a part of this process.
