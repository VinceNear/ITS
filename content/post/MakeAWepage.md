# How to make a static webpage without a server!
---

A very simple way to make a web page without hosting it yourself would be use a cloud service like gnetlify to host and build the pages for us and I am going to show you how to do that here in this guide.


## Step 1. - Register For Services
---
Register for Github. Github is a free service and while it does have paid features the features we will be using are not paid features. Go ahead and sign up for a Github account.

Here are some pictures to serve as something as a guide for those who might have trouble with registering.

Another service we will register with is Netlify which is the service that will be hosting and building our pages with tiny builds for pages.

So just to explain how all of this will go. In Github there will be some code that is built by Netlify and then compiled and hosted on Netilfy's servers. You can also make changes to this code and Netlify will build and compiled this code from the latest build you pushed to Github.

With Registrations out of the way we are noe ready to get start with setting up Github to start building our pages. On to Step 2.



## Step 2. Creating a repository/Choose a starter theme.
---
With all of our registartions done we can go to Github and open a repo. Since we will be using a framework to do this. We can open a repo with anythin that will be pushed to Netlify. So for this guide we will be starting from a start theme from some starter frameworks. I will be using Gatsby.js since it is in javascript and will will incorporate into most of my other programming tutorials I will write.

You can find a list of starter themes for Gatsby.js here at the following catalougue

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters?v=2

Found one you like? Good you'll find a "Deploy with Netlify Button" Click that and Let's go to Step 3.

## Step 3. Building Your Page with Netlify


Go a ahead and click that button to be brought to the authorization page. From this page you can authorize Netlify to open a repo and make changes to that repo.

Go ahead and allow access to the account and Netlify will start building your page with the framework we chose in this case it is Gatsby.js and when everything is done Netlify will give a link to where your page is being hosted. Congrats! You have made your very first webpage using without a physical host! But something is missing...

## Step 4. Let's change some stuff.

If you haven't noticed that the page you just made is kind of bland. Let's customize it and change some something and maybe even add a post.

From the Github repo page you can edit or create a page from the menu and you can refer to the theme's homepage for how to structure the text in the page to make a new post. New making new posts the posts will be in markdown when entering it in Github. As an example I have a picture of what my post looks like.

Remember that each theme and each page may have a different markup structure. You can also change the config file. Most of the time the config file will be self explanatory and will be easy to modify to change. Change the config file and then you should be able to see any changes you have made after a build is pushed.

That's all folks. you've pushed your first webpage to Netlify and wrote some code to Github and the best part about all of this is the fact that this is the same equipment that professionals in the industry use .

I'll be posting more tutorials next week.

Till next time!
